# Instructions

The folder is the github repo folder for a website that would the demo for a project.
The website should be in french.
The project name is "ECHO echo". 
It is a spatialized audio fiction.
The project is described by the ECHO.pdf in the doc folder
I would like the website to have the general esthetic of the ECHO.pdf
The website should be as lightweight as possible.
The main page would have the video in the video folder playing in the background (with a bit a transparency).
Several buttons corresponding to the speakers listed by the audio files in the folder should be available to clic, which launch the audio file.
A button to activate or deactivate allow to read several audio files at once. When this button is active, the website actually launch all the files in the background, and clicking on the individual buttons unmute them selectively (to ensure synchronization of the audio files.
