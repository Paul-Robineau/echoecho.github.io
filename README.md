# ECHO echo demo website

## About

ECHO echo is a spatialized audio fiction that explores the narrative possibilities of sound through an interactive experience.

It is currently only available in French.

## Usage

The website is a minimal demo in construction.

It currently offers only a playback video of the numerical version of the project, and two listening modes:

- **Individual Mode**: Click on each speaker to listen to audio tracks one by one
- **Synchronized Mode**: All sounds start together in sync. Click on speakers to activate/deactivate them individually and compose your own spatialization

More to be added on the future.
